"""Post-execution measurement and learning hooks for Aurelius.

This module provides observability-only post-execution recording:
- Records realized outcomes after execution
- Measures forecast errors
- Labels decision outcomes

This is NOT online learning. This is NOT retraining.
This is measurement only for offline analysis.

IMPORTANT:
- Read-only with respect to decisions
- Deterministic
- Side-effect free (except file writes)
- Safe in dry_run and live modes
- Failure-tolerant (never blocks execution)
