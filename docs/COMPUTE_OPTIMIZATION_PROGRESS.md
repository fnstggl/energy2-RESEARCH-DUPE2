# Compute Optimization Progress Tracker

This is the canonical progress tracker for Aurelius constraint-aware GPU orchestration.

This tracker is separate from `docs/AURELIUS_PROGRESS.md`.

`docs/AURELIUS_PROGRESS.md` may contain legacy energy-optimization or general Aurelius progress. It may be useful historical context, but it is NOT the source of truth for this constraint-aware orchestration initiative.

The source planning document is:

`docs/CONSTRAINT_AWARE_ORCHESTRATION_PLAN.md`

Every implementation run must read that plan before deciding what to do next.

## Status Summary

Current status: **PHASE 1 COMPLETE / PHASE 2 NOT STARTED**

Phase 1 produced:
- `aurelius/state/models.py` — canonical frozen dataclass state models
- `aurelius/state/store.py` — leakage-safe append-only in-memory snapshot store
- `aurelius/state/normalize.py` — adapters from existing models + validation helpers
- `aurelius/state/__init__.py` — package exports
- `tests/test_state_models.py` — 90 tests for all models
- `tests/test_state_store.py` — 18 tests for the state store
- `tests/test_state_normalize.py` — 46 tests for adapters + validation + optimizer non-regression
- `tests/fixtures/cluster_state/` — 3 JSON fixture cluster snapshots

Phase 2 (Prometheus-native telemetry ingestion) has not begun yet.

The next expected milestone is:

**Phase 2 — Prometheus-native connector**

Expected Phase 2 files:
- `aurelius/connectors/base.py`
- `aurelius/connectors/prometheus.py`
- `aurelius/connectors/dcgm.py`
- `aurelius/connectors/vllm.py`
- `aurelius/connectors/triton.py`
- Metric mapping configs
- Fake Prometheus HTTP fixtures
- Tests proving sandbox and real paths are identical

## Non-Negotiable Implementation Philosophy

This tracker is also a planning artifact, not proof of correctness.

Future implementation phases MUST NOT assume:
- the plan is complete
- the repo still matches the plan
- prior phases were implemented correctly
- passing a checklist means the feature works
- this tracker is always current

For every implementation phase, Claude MUST:

1. Re-read the high-level product goal.
2. Re-read `docs/CONSTRAINT_AWARE_ORCHESTRATION_PLAN.md`.
3. Re-read this progress tracker.
4. Independently inspect the current repo state.
5. Compare repo reality against the plan and this tracker.
6. Identify gaps the plan missed.
7. Identify assumptions invalidated by implementation.
8. Verify real code paths are wired where relevant.
9. Run tests against actual behavior.
10. Audit failure modes and missing telemetry.
11. Update this tracker with repo-reality findings.
12. Update the plan if reality differs from the plan.

A phase is NOT complete merely because:
- files were added
- functions exist
- tests pass in isolation
- checklist items were checked
- this tracker says the phase is complete

A phase is complete only when:
- the implementation is wired into the real execution path where relevant
- the behavior changes correctly in end-to-end scenarios where relevant
- missing telemetry fails safely
- old behavior is preserved when disabled
- CLI/demo paths work if relevant
- sandbox and real connectors share the same interfaces where relevant
- evidence is provided

The implementation should optimize for:
- real operational correctness
- safety
- observability
- enterprise deployability
- reproducible validation
- stable measurable improvement

NOT:
- maximizing apparent feature completeness
- satisfying the plan mechanically
- creating placeholder abstractions disconnected from real execution paths
- optimizing only synthetic benchmark scores

If the plan or tracker conflicts with repo reality:
- trust the repo
- document the mismatch
- update the relevant document

## Product Goal Reminder

Aurelius is evolving from mostly energy-aware scheduling into constraint-aware GPU orchestration for:
- AI inference providers
- neoclouds
- GPU-heavy data centers
- infrastructure/platform teams running GPU clusters

The product should help operators improve:
- cost/token
- tokens/joule
- GPU utilization
- queue wait
- p95/p99 latency
- thermal stability
- topology-aware placement
- migration safety
- SLA preservation
- operational stability

Aurelius must remain an orchestration/control-plane intelligence layer.

Allowed:
- telemetry ingestion
- state normalization
- constraint classification
- routing recommendations
- scheduler hints
- placement scoring
- topology-aware placement recommendations
- energy-aware scheduling
- thermal-aware spreading
- queue-aware scheduling
- latency/SLA-aware routing
- utilization/bin-packing recommendations
- cache-affinity hints from exposed metrics
- dry-run/recommendation-first reports

Forbidden:
- modifying NCCL
- modifying CUDA
- modifying kernels
- controlling KV cache internals
- rewriting memory allocators
- altering model execution runtime internals
- mutating customer clusters by default

## Phase 1 Completion Evidence

### Phase 1 Milestone Decision

- **What this run implemented:** Phase 1 — normalized state model (`aurelius/state/` package)
- **Why it was the correct next step:** `docs/CONSTRAINT_AWARE_ORCHESTRATION_PLAN.md` existed from Phase 0 but `aurelius/state/` did not exist. No constraint-aware telemetry layer existed. This is the prerequisite foundation for all subsequent phases.
- **Prior dependencies verified:** No prior constraint-aware phases existed. Existing energy-arbitrage phases (1-5) are complete and were explicitly left untouched.
- **What was explicitly NOT attempted:** Connectors (Phase 2-4), topology collection (Phase 5), simulator (Phase 6), constraint classifier (Phase 7), optimizer changes (Phase 9).

### Repo-Reality Audit Findings

**Plan vs repo mismatches:**
- The plan (§5.6) says to reuse `aurelius/sla/telemetry.py:WorkloadState` and extend it additively. This was not done in Phase 1 because: (a) the plan also says "Do not touch optimizer logic in this phase" and (b) extending WorkloadState requires careful testing that it doesn't break existing SLA evaluator behavior. **Decision: documented as Phase 9 work.** The new state models don't duplicate WorkloadState — they reference it via adapters.
- The plan mentioned a `QueueStateV2` wrapper with provenance. Implemented as `adapt_queue_state()` returning a dict (not a typed model) since the plan says "Reuse the existing `QueueState`" and creating a new typed model risks confusion. This is documented — Phase 2/7 can promote it if needed.
- `asdict` was imported in models.py but not used (removed by ruff fix).

**Models implemented (all from §5):**
- `Provenance` ✓
- `ConstraintType` (enum) ✓
- `TopologyLinkType` (enum) ✓
- `GPUState` (adapted from §5.4, adapts `GPUMetrics`/`GPUHealthScore`) ✓
- `InferenceServiceState` (§5.5) ✓
- `TopologyState` (§5.8) ✓
- `EnergyState` (§5.9) ✓
- `ThermalState` (§5.10) ✓
- `NodeState` (§5.3) ✓
- `RegionState` (§5.2) ✓
- `ClusterState` (§5.1) ✓
- `MigrationEvent` + `MigrationHistory` (§5.11) ✓
- `ConstraintAssessment` (§5.12) ✓
- `Recommendation` (§5.13) ✓

**What was intentionally omitted:**
- `WorkloadState` extension — Phase 9 (requires SLA engine wiring audit)
- No connector code
- No classifier code
- No optimizer changes

### Tests Added

| Test File | Tests | What It Proves |
|---|---|---|
| `tests/test_state_models.py` | 90 | All model validation (UTC-aware, None-not-zero, pct/rate ranges, JSON round-trip, enum values, property derivations, impossible value rejection) |
| `tests/test_state_store.py` | 18 | Append-only, leakage-safe lookup, out-of-order insert, range queries, latest/earliest, clear, duplicate timestamps |
| `tests/test_state_normalize.py` | 46 | validate_utc_aware, validate_percentage, validate_non_negative, make_provenance, adapt_gpu_metrics (incl. GPUHealthScore merge), adapt_queue_state, coerce_to_utc, optimizer non-regression imports |

### Commands Run

```
python -m compileall aurelius/state
ruff check aurelius/state/ tests/test_state_models.py tests/test_state_store.py tests/test_state_normalize.py
/root/.local/bin/pytest tests/test_state_models.py tests/test_state_store.py tests/test_state_normalize.py -q
/root/.local/bin/pytest tests/test_scheduler.py tests/test_safety_gate.py -q
```

### Test Results

```
tests/test_state_models.py: 90 passed
tests/test_state_store.py: 18 passed
tests/test_state_normalize.py: 46 passed
total Phase 1: 154 passed, 0 failed

tests/test_scheduler.py: 10 passed (existing, unmodified)
tests/test_safety_gate.py: 10 passed (existing, unmodified)
ruff: All checks passed
python -m compileall: No errors
```

### Proof Optimizer Behavior Was Not Changed

- No file in `aurelius/optimization/`, `aurelius/backtesting/`, `aurelius/sla/`, `aurelius/forecasting/`, or `aurelius/models.py` was modified.
- `tests/test_scheduler.py` and `tests/test_safety_gate.py` pass identically to before.
- `test_state_normalize.py::TestOptimizerUnchanged` explicitly tests that `JobScheduler`, `ObjectiveFunction`, existing `QueueState`/`GPUMetrics`/`GPUHealthScore`, `WorkloadState`, and `ActionType` all import cleanly with unchanged behavior.

### Wiring Evidence

Phase 1 is additive groundwork. The state models are NOT yet wired into any production decision path — this is intentional and documented. Wiring happens in:
- Phase 2 (connector produces `ClusterState`)
- Phase 7 (classifier consumes `ClusterState`)
- Phase 9 (optimizer/engine produces `Recommendation`)

**Which paths are intentionally not wired yet:**
- `BacktestEngine` still constructs `JobScheduler` without ClusterState
- CLI `simulate`/`backtest` paths still use old energy-arbitrage flow
- `SLARegistry` is still dormant (Phase 9 target)

### Failure Mode Review

- **Missing telemetry:** All optional fields default to `None`. The classifier (Phase 7) will treat `None` as `missing_signal` and reduce confidence — not fabricate a value.
- **Naive timestamps:** Rejected at model construction time with a clear `ValueError`. The `coerce_to_utc()` helper provides an explicit escape hatch for synthetic sources.
- **Invalid ranges:** All impossible values (pct > 100, negative bytes, pct < 0, PUE < 1.0, etc.) raise `ValueError` at construction time — never silently accepted.
- **Partial connector failures:** `ClusterState.is_partial=True` + `missing_sources` list enables the classifier to reduce confidence proportionally.

Benchmark / Optimization Philosophy

The verification and optimization stage is not one-and-done.

Constraint-aware optimization must improve over multiple routine runs until the system demonstrates:

* stable safe net improvement
* no significant SLA regression
* bounded migration churn
* robustness across workload classes
* robustness across constraint scenarios
* robustness under partial telemetry
* meaningful improvement vs current_price_only
* meaningful improvement vs existing Aurelius energy-aware optimization where applicable

The simulator is not reality.

Optimization strategies that improve simulator metrics while likely degrading real-world behavior must be treated as regressions.

Benchmark comparisons must preserve controlled variables:

* same workload mix
* same seed
* same topology
* same energy trace
* same SLA config
* same simulator version
* same scenario version

A reported improvement is invalid if benchmark conditions changed without being clearly labeled.

Aurelius must optimize net operational quality, not isolated savings metrics.

Current Known Risks

* The SLA engine exists but is not yet wired into real optimizer/backtest paths (Phase 9 target).
* `WorkloadState` extension (adding `service_id`, `gpu_uuids`, etc.) is deferred to Phase 9 to avoid breaking SLA evaluator while it is still dormant.
* Phase 1 state models are additive; no production decision path yet consumes them.
* Constraint classifier (Phase 7) has not been built — ClusterState is produced but not consumed.
* Simulator (Phase 6) has not been built — state models are not yet exercised end-to-end.
* Benchmarking does not yet prove multi-constraint optimization.

## Phase 1 Open Technical Debt

| Item | Priority | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `WorkloadState` extension (add `service_id`, `gpu_uuids`, `kv_cache_usage`, `comm_bytes_per_s`) | Medium | Deferred to Phase 9; existing SLA evaluator still consumes the original shape |
| `QueueStateV2` typed model with provenance | Low | Currently a dict; can be promoted in Phase 2 once connector wiring is clearer |
| JSON schema validation for fixture files | Low | Fixtures are tested via `ClusterState.from_dict()` round-trip, not schema validation |
| `StateStore` Postgres persistence layer | Medium | Phase 1 is in-memory only; Postgres integration is a Phase 11/12 concern |
| DCGMProvider unit bug (throttle ns vs µs) | Medium | Documented in §6.3 of the plan; Phase 3 will fix `dcgm_provider.py` |
